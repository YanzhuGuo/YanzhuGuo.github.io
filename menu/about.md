I completed my Bachelor's degree in Linguistics at the University of Barcelona in 2015 with honours. During my studies, I spent half a year in Saint Petersburg, Russia, with a generous Eranet-Mundus Mobility scholarship.

After that, I followed the Erasmus Mundus Master [Language and Communication Technologies](https://lct-master.org/), which took me to Saarland University (Saarbr√ºcken, Germany) and the University of Malta (Msida, Malta), for a year each. 

During my studies, I worked as a student assistant in four occasions for the University of Barcelona, Universitat Pompeu Fabra and the University of Saarland, working in different (computational) linguistics-related topics, such as corpus annotation.

My mother tongue is Catalan, I speak Spanish fluently, English and Russian decently enough, and some French and German.
