Hi, I'm a PhD student in ALMANnaCH at Inria Paris advised by Chloé Clavel. I'm also affiliated with DaSciM at Ecole Polytechnique. My research focuses on the evaluation and alignment of language models, particularly regarding aspects such as multilinguality and diversity. I’m interested in developing metrics to concretize linguistic capabilities of LLMs and developping actionable algorithms to improve LLMs on these metrics.

Before my PhD, I completed an engineering diploma at Ecole Polytechnique and an undergraduate degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I also spent some time as an research intern at Apple.

I come from Beijing and have lived in New York and Shanghai before temporarily settling in Paris. I enjoy learning new languages and exploring off-the-beaten-path destinations through slow travel. I also love to paint, make pottery and write creative non fiction.
