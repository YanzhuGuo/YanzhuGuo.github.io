Hi, I'm an assistant professor in the [DIG](https://dig.telecom-paris.fr/blog/) team at [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr), [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr) since December 2025.

Previously I was a PhD student in [ALMANnaCH](https://almanach.inria.fr/index-fr.html) at Inria Paris advised by [Chloé Clavel](https://clavel.wp.imt.fr/). I was also affiliated with [DaSciM](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/dascim/) at Ecole Polytechnique. My research focuses on the evaluation and alignment of large language models, particularly regarding linguistic aspects such as diversity and multilingualism.

I completed an engineering diploma at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) and an undergraduate degree at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I also spent some time as a research intern at [Apple AIML](https://machinelearning.apple.com/).

I come from Beijing and have lived in New York and Shanghai before settling in Paris for the moment. I enjoy learning new languages and exploring off-the-beaten-path destinations through solo backpacking. I also love to paint, make pottery and write creative non fiction.
