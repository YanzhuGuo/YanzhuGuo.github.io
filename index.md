Hi, I'm a PhD student in [ALMANnaCH](https://almanach.inria.fr/index-fr.html) at Inria Paris advised by [Chloé Clavel](https://clavel.wp.imt.fr/). I'm also affiliated with DaSciM at Ecole Polytechnique. My research focuses on the evaluation and alignment of language models, particularly regarding lingusitic aspects such as linguistic diversity and multilingualism.

I completed an engineering diploma at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) and an undergraduate degree at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I also spent some time as an research intern at [Apple AIML](https://machinelearning.apple.com/).

I come from Beijing and have lived in New York and Shanghai before temporarily settling in Paris. I enjoy learning new languages and exploring off-the-beaten-path destinations through slow travel. I also love to paint, make pottery and write creative non fiction.
