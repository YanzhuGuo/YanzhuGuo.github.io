I'm a third-year PhD student at the TLP group of the LIMSI lab, in Orsay, France, under the supervision of Marianna Apidianaki and Alexandre Allauzen. My thesis is part of the ANR [MultiSem](https://sites.google.com/view/multisem/home) project.

My broad research area is Natural Language Processing, and more concretely I am working on Computational Lexical Semantics with a focus on the adaptation of linguistic representations to semantic properties of words.

I'm particularly interested in representations of words and meaning in context, but my general research interests also include paraphrasing, lexical style and semantic ambiguity.
